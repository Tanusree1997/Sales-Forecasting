This project aims to make sales forecasting based on retail store sales (2014-2017). Utilizing Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn a time series model has been developed for future sales prediction. For this, I am using a Kaggle Retail Store dataset consisting of Order dates and Sales values which are essential for this Time Series Analysis. 

Tool used: Google Colab
